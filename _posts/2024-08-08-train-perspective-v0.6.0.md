Changelog:

- **Fixed:** Delayed camera movement when train turns.
  - (I believe this is not working on 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 as of now. Oops!)
- **Added:** Debug option to display new value scales used to fix the aforementioned delayed camera movement.
- **Fixed:** Incompatibility with Figura combined with some mods. [#67](https://github.com/der-fruhling-entertainment/create-train-perspective/issues/67)
  - (fixed via possibly temporary workaround. please report any other issues with this mod and mine! it likes to get breaky)
- **Technical:** Cleaned up the code a bit more.
